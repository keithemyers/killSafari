<B>killSafari Launch Daemon</B>

This will kill the Safri process if running. This is used so that students are forced to use Chrome to browse the web. Chrome is preferred due to the amount of control it offers versus Safari.

Copy file to: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.itech.killSafari.plist

Then run: sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.itech.killSafari.plist
